Greetings folks,

I go by K.

I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at [the Jerry Moran Center for Advanced Virtual Engineering & Testing lab](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/Laboratories/avet/avet.php), part of [the National Institute for Aviation Research](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/) - NIAR - in Wichita, KS. My work focuses on aircraft crashworthiness, certification by analysis, simulation, and data-driven models. I also contribute foundational research to various projects and collaborate with the aerospace engineering department to prepare students for the workforce.

My career journey spans over a decade in international R&D and engineering roles within the aerospace and automotive industries. I have worked on simulation, analysis, and certification projects as both an R&D engineer and a subcontractor. For a detailed overview of my professional background, feel free to explore [my cv](https://drko-curius.github.io/cv/) or visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khadijaouajjani/).

Since 2012, I have been an active, internationally mobile and polyglot engineer within a multinational private industry environment. While working on an aircraft certification project within Safran, I came to peace with my thirst for learning, my relentless curiosity and my excitment in pushing the frontiers of what is feasible in mathematically approaching reality. I decided to pursue higher degrees which would provide more structure and legitimacy to my knowledge acquistion in the hard STEM field, not to mention an established ticket into R&D offices.

In 2016, after earning a [Fulbright scholarship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), I once more uprooted my Casawi life, this time for the U.S., in Wichita, KS. I pursued my Masters and PhD in aerospace engineering at Wichia State University while maintaining my career in the aircraft industry. The rest is a tumultuous history that warrants its own time.

Throughout my PhD, I was fully funded by AVET. I benefitted from the co-advising and mentorship of [Dr. Olivares](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerardo-Olivares-6), on top of the full support of my main advisor [Dr. James E. Steck](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Steck). The latter's involvement in machine learning and quantum computing inspired me to put in-praxis my curiosity about both fields: I actively learned about AI, and have been investigating its benefits for numerical models, and ways to incorporate it in our research and in aerospace technologies advancement. I also successfully pursued a minor in quantum mechanics under the guidance of the dynamite [Dr. Elizabeth Behrman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth-Behrman), who has been my first nonfictional inspirational scientist idol (Rest in peace, [Dr. Isakov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Isakov), another cherished mentor).

Beyond the ecstasy of technical knowledge acquisition and application, I [write](https://www.hurrytothecapsule.com/). I [read](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/exupere). I mentor. I go on [walks with dogs](https://beautiesandbeasts.org/). I assemble [furniture](https://www.rescue.org/united-states/wichita-ks). I play videogames. I acquire new languages. I meet new people. I discover local live music holes (Check out [Kirby's](https://kirbysbeerstore.com/) if you are in Kansas). I use coffee shops, inclusve divebars and cheap terraces as study/reading/writing spots.

And more often than not, I am at the cusp of being a challenged apprentice uncovering new territory, and a seasoned practitioner deepening trodden paths.
