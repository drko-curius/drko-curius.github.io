Greetings folks,

I go by K.

I am currently a postodoctoral scientist at [the Jerry Moran Center for Advanced Virtual Engineering & Testing lab](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/Laboratories/avet/avet.php), which is part of [the National Institute for Aviation Research](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/) - NIAR - in Wichita, KS. I essentially conduct research within the scope of aircraft crashworthiness, certification by analysis, simulation and data-driven models, while still providing the fundamental scholarly leg work on other projects, and collaborating with the aerospace engineering department on students' preparation for the workforce.

My previous work experience involved simulation, analysis and certification work for different international companies in aircraft and automotive industries, both as an R&D engineer or as a subcontractor. Feel free to check [my cv](https://drko-curius.github.io/cv/) for more details.

I have been an active engineer with the industry since 2012. While working on a certification project within Safran, I came to peace with my thirst for learning, my relentless curiosity and my excitment in pushing the frontiers or what is feasible in mathemathically approaching reality. I decided to pursue higher degrees which would provide more structure and legitimacy to my knowledge acquistion in the hard STEM field, not to mention an established ticket into R&D rooms.

In 2016, after earning a [Fulbright scholarship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), I uprooted my Casawi life and landed in Wichita, KS, to pursue higher degrees in aerospace engineering. The rest is a tumultuous history that warrants its own time.

Throughout my PhD, I benefitted from AVET's full funding and the co-advising and mentorship of [Dr. Olivares](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerardo-Olivares-6), on top of the full support of my main advisor [Dr. James E. Steck](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Steck). The latter's involvement in machine learning and quantum computing inspired me to actively learn about AI, see its benefits for numerical models and incorporate it in our research and in aerospace technologies advancement. I also successfully pursued a minor in quantum mechanics by the dynamite [Dr. Elizabeth Behrman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth-Behrman), who has been my first nonfictional inspirational scientist idol (Rest in peace, [Dr. Isakov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Isakov). You were another one as well).

I earned my PhD in aerospace engineering from Wichita State University in Fall 2024.

I write. I read. I go on walks with dogs. I assemble furniture. I play videogames. I acquire new languages. I meet new people.

Most importantly, I am always at the cusp of being a challenged apprentice uncovering new territory, and a seasoned practitioner deepening trodden paths.
