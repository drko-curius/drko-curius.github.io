Greetings folks,

I go by K.

I am currently a postodoctoral scientist at [the Jerry Moran Center for Advanced Virtual Engineering & Testing lab](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/Laboratories/avet/avet.php), which is part of [the National Institute for Aviation Research](https://www.wichita.edu/industry_and_defense/NIAR/) - NIAR - in Wichita, KS. I essentially conduct research within the scope of aircraft crashworthiness, certification by analysis, simulation and data-driven models, while still providing the fundamental scholarly leg work on other projects, and collaborating with the aerospace engineering department on students' preparation for the workforce.

My previous work experience involved simulation, analysis and certification work for different international companies in aircraft and automotive industries, both as an R&D engineer and a subcontractor. Feel free to check [my cv](https://drko-curius.github.io/cv/) or my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khadijaouajjani/) for more details.

Since 2012, I have been an active, internationally mobile and polyglot engineer within a multinational private industry environment. While working on an aircraft certification project within Safran, I came to peace with my thirst for learning, my relentless curiosity and my excitment in pushing the frontiers or what is feasible in mathemathically approaching reality. I decided to pursue higher degrees which would provide more structure and legitimacy to my knowledge acquistion in the hard STEM field, not to mention an established ticket into R&D offices.

In 2016, after earning a [Fulbright scholarship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/), I once more uprooted my Casawi life, this time for the U.S., in Wichita, KS. I pursed my Masters and PhD in aerospace engineering at Wichia State University while maintaining my career in aircraft industries. The rest is a tumultuous history that warrants its own time.

Throughout my PhD, I benefitted from AVET's full funding, as well as the co-advising and mentorship of [Dr. Olivares](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gerardo-Olivares-6), on top of the full support of my main advisor [Dr. James E. Steck](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Steck). The latter's involvement in machine learning and quantum computing inspired me to put in-praxis my curiosity about both fields: I actively learned about AI, and have been investigating its benefits for numerical models, and ways to incorporate it in our research and in aerospace technologies advancement. I also successfully pursued a minor in quantum mechanics under the dynamite [Dr. Elizabeth Behrman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth-Behrman), who has been my first nonfictional inspirational scientist idol (Rest in peace, [Dr. Isakov](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Isakov). You were another one as well).

I [write](https://www.hurrytothecapsule.com/). I [read](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/exupere). I mentor. I go on [walks with dogs](https://beautiesandbeasts.org/). I assemble [furniture](https://www.rescue.org/united-states/wichita-ks). I play videogames. I acquire new languages. I meet new people. I discover local live music holes (Check out [Kirby's](https://kirbysbeerstore.com/) if you are in Kansas). I use coffee shops, inclusve divebars and cheap terraces as study/reading/writing spots.

And more often than not, I am at the cusp of being a challenged apprentice uncovering new territory, and a seasoned practitioner deepening trodden paths.
